# Number-Plate-Detection-using-Ai
👨‍💻 Developer: Muhammad Faizan Sami
Institution: Superior University

🎯 Introduction:
My name is Muhammad Faizan Sami, and I am a student at Superior University. The project I have developed is titled "Number Plate Detection using Python." The main objective of this project is to build an AI-based system that can detect and read vehicle number plates automatically using computer vision.

In today’s world, number plate detection plays a vital role in various fields such as traffic monitoring, automated parking systems, security surveillance, and toll collection. This project aims to automate the process of reading number plates from live video feeds, which reduces human effort and increases accuracy.

🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python – The main programming language for the entire project.

OpenCV (cv2) – For handling image and video processing, and accessing webcam feed.

YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) – A pre-trained deep learning model used for object detection to locate the number plate in a frame.

EasyOCR – An Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library used to extract text (i.e., the number) from the detected plate area.

PyTorch – A machine learning framework used to load and run the YOLO model.

NumPy – For handling numerical operations on image data.

Requests & Pandas (if needed) – For handling additional data operations and API communication.

⚙️ How the Project Works (Step-by-Step Explanation):
Start Webcam Feed:
The program first accesses the system webcam using cv2.VideoCapture(), which continuously provides live video frames.

Detect Number Plate Using YOLOv5:
Each frame is passed to the YOLOv5 model, which detects objects. In this case, we focus on detecting the vehicle's number plate region.

Crop the Detected Region:
Once the plate is located, the program crops the number plate area from the frame.

Extract Text Using EasyOCR:
The cropped image is then passed to the EasyOCR reader, which reads and returns the text (the actual number on the plate).

Display Results in Real-Time:
The detected number is displayed on the screen in real-time along with a bounding box around the plate.

✅ Applications and Use Cases:
Smart Parking Systems – For automatic entry and exit logging

Traffic Surveillance – Monitoring and logging speeding or illegal parking

Security Systems – For identifying unauthorized vehicles

Toll Booths – For automated toll collection based on plate numbers

🚀 Future Improvements:
Add a database system to log and store detected number plates

Integrate license plate verification using government or vehicle APIs

Improve accuracy by training the model with local datasets

Enable multi-language recognition for non-English plates

👨‍💻 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how AI and computer vision can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently. With tools like Python, YOLOv5, and EasyOCR, number plate detection becomes not only possible but highly accurate and scalable. I hope to expand this project further into a full-fledged smart traffic management system.

Thank you!
